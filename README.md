# Randfacts-Rest-Api

This is a version of a python module called Randfacts but it is a rest API, so you don't need to install anything.
You can use a deployed vesion of this at [https://randfacts-api.herokuapp.com/](https://randfacts-api.herokuapp.com/)

Currently this is fairly new so you can only access [https://randfacts-api.herokuapp.com/fact/safe](https://randfacts-api.herokuapp.com/fact/safe) for safe facts and [https://randfacts-api.herokuapp.com/fact/unsafe](https://randfacts-api.herokuapp.com/fact/unsafe) for unsafe facts.

The origional python module: [Randfacts](https://github.com/TabulateJarl8/randfacts)
